      <description>Hello everyone. Last a few weeks I was thinking about making ozantopal.com great again. ðŸ˜„ On that days, Hugo entered my life, thanks to Furkan&amp;rsquo;s advice. Hugo is a framework for building websites. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a static page generator. It&amp;rsquo;s written with Go and Hugo is quite fast.
After all those compliment to Hugo; I would like to return my main subject. Today, I wanna tell you about migration of my blog to Hugo and how I maintain new posts on that new &amp;lsquo;cms&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Hello there, this is Ozan and this is next one of my numerous blogging trials. Hopefully, this time I keep continue to blogging.
Content of this blog will be mostly about programming but still I do not guarantee that I won&amp;rsquo;t write on different topics.
Until I see you all soon, keep digging!</description>
